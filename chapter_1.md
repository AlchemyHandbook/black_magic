# CHAPTER 1

I suppose I should preface this chapter with my failure in attempting to contain whatever force I conjured within my tomes from hijacking my mind,
or almost doing so. It wasn't really so much the fear that had taken over, but rather the realization that I no longer had control.  
The experiment was a frustrating failure to say the least. Had I simply allowed the spells to remain in their tomes, I wouldn't be writing this  
lets just say. I also underestimated the power of the moon, even half lit, to amplify magic. Why? How does the moon do that?  

For much of my life I always pondered why alchemy sigils are able to exert an aura that is usually detected through dowsing rods?
After a while you begin to have a mastery of leylines and you can simply detect them simply using your hands. I remember an experiment I did once to
finally solve part of this mystery. I thought that if I could mount the dowsing rods onto an object and walk around them with an alchemical sigil
I could get the dowsing rods to move and drag towards the rods. To my surprise I did not expect the dowsing rods to simply just sit there and do nothing.
I came to the conclusion that perhaps a human element is needed in order for the rods to work. This bothered me though because I knew human error
could slightly tilt the rods in any way causing a false positive, or at least in some cases.
