# CHAPTER 1

I suppose I should preface this chapter with my failure in attempting to contain whatever force I conjured within my tomes from hijacking my mind,
or almost doing so. It wasn't really so much the fear that had taken over, but rather the realization that I no longer had control.  
The experiment was a frustrating failure to say the least. Had I simply allowed the spells to remain in their tomes, I wouldn't be writing this  
lets just say. I also underestimated the power of the moon, even half lit, to amplify magic. Why? How does the moon do that?  

For much of my life I always pondered why alchemy sigils are able to exert an aura that is usually detected through dowsing rods?
After a while you begin to have a mastery of leylines and you can simply detect them simply using your hands. I remember an experiment I did once to
finally solve part of this mystery. I thought that if I could mount the dowsing rods onto an object and walk around them with an alchemical sigil
I could get the dowsing rods to move and drag towards the rods. To my surprise I did not expect the dowsing rods to simply just sit there and do nothing.
I came to the conclusion that perhaps a human element is needed in order for the rods to work. This bothered me though because I knew human error
could slightly tilt the rods in any way causing a false positive, or at least in some cases.  
  
However if that human element is needed for dowsing rods to work, then maybe alchemy sigils affect the mind rather than any principle of physics per say.
Something sat in as I thought about this conclusion. I accepted this notion. I accepted the notion that perhaps there is this something else that affects 
the mind. I remembered a case study where a young girl was going insane and her parents tried many things to try and remedy her mental state. After giving
up on conventional methods such as medicine and therapy, they turned to a tribal healer. Unfortunetly he wasn't able to help much as she eventually killed
herself(or maybe she was sent to an insitution?). However after the young girl left her room, the tribal healer went in to search for something the parents
asked him to get. It was then that he noticed something near the head of her bed: it was an alchemy sigil, particularly similiar to the one representing
the 'philospher's stone'(the one with the circle encasing a triangle and a square). I recalled this case as I considered the results of the experiment.

I should have heeded the consequences of this unfortunate case when I decided to started drawing sigils that I had saw from when I sensed a strange
presence in my room. I always thought it was some sort of shadow from the mirror, but now I'm not so sure. Regardless during these episodes I would think of
alchemical symbols that I thought were a form of defense against these entities. I was somewhat wrong. In the beginning one alchemy sigil would help me 
rest and thwart these 'presences', but in the end having too many made me go mad.
